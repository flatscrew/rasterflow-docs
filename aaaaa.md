✴️ Core Features

Non-Destructive Editing
Every operation exists within a live node graph. You can adjust, reconnect, or reorder any part of the process without losing previous steps — the entire workflow remains reversible.

254+ Image Operations
RasterFlow provides the complete GEGL library: filters, color tools, generators, distortions, and blend modes ready to combine in any order.

Instant Visualization
Every node previews its output in real time. No rendering delays, no refresh buttons — what you see is what the graph produces.

Undo & Redo Support
Experiment freely knowing every action can be reversed. RasterFlow keeps your creative flow safe and recoverable.

Built with GTK4 & Vala
A fully native application with smooth performance and responsive interaction, even in large, complex graphs.

Cross-Platform
RasterFlow runs on both Linux and Windows using open technologies — no dependencies outside GEGL and GTK.

⚙️ Workflow & Tools

Fluid Navigation & Zoom
Navigate your graph naturally with mouse or touchpad. Zoom smoothly in and out to focus on details or get a full overview of your composition.

Minimap Overview
A built-in minimap gives you instant orientation in large graphs. Node colors and structure stay clear even in complex networks.

Custom Node Colors
Organize your graphs visually. Assign colors to nodes or groups to highlight structure and logic — perfectly mirrored on the minimap.

Save What You See
Export any node’s output directly to an image file, or export the entire graph as a PNG snapshot for documentation and sharing.

Visual Debugging
Preview intermediate results and inspect connections in real time. Perfect for understanding the flow of data through your image.

Precise Parameter Control
Adjust values numerically or interactively. Small tweaks can transform the entire look of your composition.

🧬 Creative & Procedural

Procedural Generators
Start from noise, grids, gradients, or patterns. RasterFlow lets you build images from nothing but math and imagination.

Compositing Made Modular
Replace flat layer stacks with logic-driven graphs. Blend, mask, and combine images through explicit connections you can always see.

Graph Properties
Expose key parameters as global controls. Adjust them live and see changes propagate instantly across the graph.

Detachable Viewers
Pop out any node into its own live window to compare stages, monitor different outputs, or analyze color and detail independently.

Game-Dev Ready
Assemble HDRP mask maps, generate channel-packed textures, or combine data for procedural materials — all directly inside RasterFlow.

Endless Experimentation
RasterFlow is an image editor and generator built for discovery. Every node, link, and adjustment is part of a living process.
